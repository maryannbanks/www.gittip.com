                <h2>Personal Information</h2>

                <p>We immediately clear out most of the information in your
                profile (though it may still exist in our database in event
                        logs, to be fully deleted once we sort out our <a
                        href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/397">data
                        retention policy</a>).</p>

                <p>Things we clear immediately include your &ldquo;making the
                world better&rdquo; statement, any funding goal, the tips
                you're receiving, and those you're giving. You'll also be
                removed from any communities and teams you were a part of. If
                you're closing a team account, all team members will be removed
                from the team.</p>

                <p>We specifically <i>don't</i> delete your past giving and
                receiving history on the site, because that information also
                belongs equally to other users (the ones you gave to and
                received from).</p>

                <p>After you close your account, your profile page will say,
                &ldquo;The account owner has closed this account.&rdquo;</p>


                <h2>Username</h2>

                <p>We may give your username to someone else if they ask for
                it, but not for at least a year after you close your account
                (unless we determine that you've been infringing a
                        trademark).</p>

                <p>Until we give your username to someone else, you can use it
                again if you ever decide to rejoin Gratipay. Simply sign in.</p>
