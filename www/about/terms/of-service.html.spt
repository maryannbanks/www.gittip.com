<li> <p>Authorization to Charge or Credit Accounts</p>

<p>Each time you initiate or accept a gift transaction through the Gratipay
Services, you authorize Gratipay to charge or credit the accounts involved, to
correct any errors in the transaction and to resubmit any transaction that is
rejected by the applicable financial institution. Your authorization will
remain in full force and effect until you terminate such authorization in
writing.</p> 

</li> 


<li> <p>Sending Gifts</p>

<p><i>Transaction Limits.</i> Gratipay may, in its discretion, impose limits on
the transactions you can send through the Gratipay Services.</p>

<p><i>Payment Methods Accepted.</i> Gratipay allows users to send gifts using
selected payment methods identified on the transaction screens within the
Gratipay Services. Gratipay reserves the right to change accepted methods of
payment at any time and in its sole discretion. You may be required to verify
that you control the accounts that you register prior to using the cards for
transactions. If you use a credit card, you agree to comply with all applicable
card association and network rules.</p>

<p><i>Accuracy of Information.</i> You are responsible for confirming the
accuracy of the information you provide about each gift you send, including the
identity of the recipient and the amount of the transaction. Once a gift
transaction is initiated, you may not change, withdraw or cancel your
authorization for Gratipay to complete the transaction.</p>

<p><i>Refused and Refunded Transactions.</i> When sending a gift, the recipient
is not required to accept it. You agree that you will not hold Gratipay liable
for any damages resulting from a recipient's decision not to accept a gift made
through Gratipay. Gratipay will return any unclaimed, refunded or denied gift
within thirty (30) business days of the date you initiate the gift.  If a gift
is unclaimed, denied or refunded for any reason, Gratipay will return the money
to your original payment method, if possible. If for any reason Gratipay is
unable to return unclaimed, refunded or denied gifts, Gratipay may deliver such
funds to your state of residency as unclaimed property. Gratipay will determine
your state of residency based on the address you provide when you register for
an account.</p>

Services, you must be a registered Gratipay user and provide account information
for a valid checking, savings or other ACH-enabled bank account.  Funds
transfers to bank accounts usually occur between one to three (1-3) business
days for all transactions.</p>

<p><i>Reversals, Chargebacks and Claims.</i> When you receive a gift, you are
liable to Gratipay for the full amount of the gift, plus any fees, if the payment
is later invalidated for any reason. This means that you will be responsible
for reimbursing Gratipay if you lose a claim or a chargeback or if there is a
reversal of the gift.</p> 

</li> 


<li> <p>Taxes</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the
gifts you make or receive, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and
remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. Gratipay is not
responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transaction or for
collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any
transaction.</p> 

</li>

<p>Gratipay reserves the right to charge service fees based on the total amount
of your transaction. Such fees are subject to change without notice and in
Gratipay's sole discretion. All Gratipay fees will be disclosed to you before you
complete your transaction.</p>
