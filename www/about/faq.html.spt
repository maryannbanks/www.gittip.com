        <dd>Gratipay is weekly payments, motivated by gratitude. Gratipay is
        sustainable funding, with no extra fees and no strings attached.</dd>


        <dt id="who-gittip">Who is Gratipay?</dt>

        <dd>Gratipay, LLC is an <a
          href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open
          company</a> founded by <a href="/whit537/">Chad Whitacre</a> in 2002
        as Zeta Web Design Company, and renamed to Gratipay, LLC in February,
        2013. Anyone is welcome to <a href="/for/contributors/">contribute</a>
         to building Gratipay. You can see the members of the
        Gratipay team <a href="/Gratipay/members/">here</a>.</dd>


        <dt id="how-funded">How is Gratipay funded?</dt>

        <dd>Gratipay is funded on Gratipay. As an <a
            href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open
            company</a>, Gratipay, LLC doesn't pay any wages and has no profit.
        We <a href="/about/#details">charge a fee</a> to cover the things that
        we ourselves are charged for.</dd>


        <dt id="one-time-gift">Can I make a one-time gift?</dt>

        <dd>No. Gratipay is designed for long-term, sustainable funding, and only
        supports recurring gifts at this time. We will probably offer one-time
        gifts in the future; you can join that conversation <a
            href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/5">here</a>.
        The workaround for now is to change your gift amount back to zero after
        the first week.</dd>


        <dt id="not-in-us">I'm not in the U.S., can I still use Gratipay?</dt>

        <dd>Yes, but moving funds takes more time and the fees are higher.</dd>


        <dt id="how-add-funds">How do I add funds to Gratipay?</dt>

        <dd>There are two ways to add funds to Gratipay:

        <dt id="maximum-amount">Is there a minimum or maximum amount I can give or receive?</dt>

        <dd>There are no restrictions on the total amount you can give
        or receive.</dd>

        <dd>The minimum you can give any one person is 1Â¢ per week. To minimize
        processing fees, we charge your credit card at least $10 at a time
        (anything extra stays in Gratipay to use in future weeks).</dd>

        <dd>The maximum you can give any one person is $100 per week. The max
        you can give any one company or organization is $1,000 per week. This
        helps reduce volatility by reducing how dependent income is on a few
        large patrons.</dd>


        <dt id="support-organizations">Can I use Gratipay to support organizations?</dt>

        <dd>Yes. Some accounts on Gratipay represent organizations.</dd>

        or organization's website. Also, Twitter verifies accounts in instances
        where this is particularly relevant, so check their Twitter account
        carefully if it's linked.</dd>
